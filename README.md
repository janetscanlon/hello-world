### This is the jumping off point from Google's Workshop: 
# Google Cloud Generative AI for Node.js Developers # 

This project is Work-In-Progress‚õèÔ∏è but currently features: 
1. Code written with Google Cloud Shell Editor
2. Application stored in Github (üìçyou are here!)
3. App Deployment via Google Cloud Run
4. Generative AI using Vertex AI

I am currently brainstorming how I'd like to further develop this app. 
I'd like to make a tool for Actors to use that includes Gen-AI. 
Perhaps: 

- AI that can read and perform lines with the actor, allowing for practice without a human partner. It can adapt its responses based on the actor's performance.
- AI to analyze scripts, break down character arcs, suggest character motivations, and provide emotional tone annotations.
- An AI tool that analyzes an actor's past performances, skills, and physical attributes to suggest suitable roles and casting opportunities.
